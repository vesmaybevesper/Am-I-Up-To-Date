At this time I have no plans to port to Forge/NeoForge as they arent platforms I'm interested in. Feel free to make your own port (or submit a pull request) and let me know so I can link people to it

My main reason for creating this mod was due to the lack of a good way to be alerted to updates in the Modrinth Launcher and third party launchers (MultiMC, Prism, etc). The Curseforge launcher does a much better job of making updates known so I have no plans to suppoort CurseForge packs at this time.
